      "description": "In the 21st century, also called the Information Age, data has become increasingly valuable due to technological developments. Machines become extremely 'intelligent' to the point that even scientists cannot predict where this journey will lead. Data Science, 'the sexiest job of the 21st century' as declared by Harvard Business Review, is the combination of programming and mathematics in order to design models capable of extracting insights or making predictions better and faster compared to humans. Unprocessed data makes your business inefficient. It is only after the data has been processed that the right insights can be revealed and the analysis created in the light of these insights will carry your business to the peak of its potential. Because data is the most valuable thing of our age, reveal the value of data.\n\nData Acquisition\nIf there is not enough data to analyze, we could create the data pipeline if it is accessible or guide you to create an appropriate data acquisition system.\nData Preprocessing\nData sources are not reliable. Therefore, we cleaned the data of inaccurate, aberrant and noisy ones to create more accurate models.\nModel Design\nWe designed a mathematical or machine learning model that describes your system as well as possible.\nData Analysis\nBy using the model trained by your data, we could reveal the insights of your current or upcoming data stream.\nReport/Result\nWe could demonstrate the insights revealed by our model in a user-friendly dashboard.\nThere are mainly 3 techniques in data science;\n\nClassification\nModels are trained in such a way as to label data according to users' preferences. The most explanatory and cliché example of this method is spam or ham mail labeling. From the dataset, the model learns the difference between ham and spam mails and could easily label upcoming mails accordingly.\nRegression\nBasically, regression is finding the best-fitting function for the dataset. By using this function, correlation in the dataset or prediction of the future could be achieved.\nClustering\nIn scenarios where the number of classes is not predefined as in classification problems, models could be trained in such a way as to divide the dataset. These classes would help us understand the relationship and distribution in the dataset.\nData Science techniques are mainly used in;\n\nDecision Making and Prediction\nProcess Optimization\nPattern Recognition\nData Analytics\nRecommendation Systems\nComputer Vision\nTechnologies we use:\n\n",
